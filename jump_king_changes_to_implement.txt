* When just chilling on a ground line, the player isn't actually on top of it. He's sinking a bit into it.
* Collisions need a bit of work as well. We need to see what line is the closest if more are making contact with the 
	player at the same time, and then only activate the collision that's closest to it.
* Currently the game crashes when going up to level 3 because we don't actually have that level, we only have level 1 and 2
* Also, the screen is VERY weight at times, when you change the screen even other screen that you have change. I need to made all that smoother
